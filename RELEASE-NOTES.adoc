== 1.0

When upgrading from 0.5 a few packages where changed. It was decided to make a clean module package correspondance.

Hence e.g.

- `org.meeuw.i18n.Region` -> `org.meeuw.i18n.regions.Region`
- `org.meeuw.i18n.RegionService` -> `org.meeuw.i18n.regions.RegionService`

Testing is also done with java 11 modules. The artifacts are still compatible with java 8 though.
