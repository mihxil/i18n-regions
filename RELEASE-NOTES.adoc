== 1.2
Updated to i18n 1.28 (support for Northern Ireland)

== 1.1

The main reason for this release was lowering some log statement. We log with jul, but it is a bit cumbersome to configure it for everytime. We just lowered to log to FINE.

== 1.0

When upgrading from 0.5, a few packages where changed. It was decided to make a clean module package correspondence.

Hence, e.g.

- `org.meeuw.i18n.Region` -> `org.meeuw.i18n.regions.Region`
- `org.meeuw.i18n.RegionService` -> `org.meeuw.i18n.regions.RegionService`

Testing is also done with java 11 modules. The artifacts are still compatible with java 8 though.
